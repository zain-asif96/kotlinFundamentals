     * Your team likes the data class you designed, but finds it repetitive to write code each time they need an event's duration as a string:
     * val durationOfEvent = if (events[0].durationInMinutes < 60) {"short"} else {"long"}
     * println("Duration of first event of the day: $durationOfEvent")
     * While you could fix this repetition by adding a method directly to the class, that is not ideal, as other teams started using your event class in their apps. If the class changes, they would need to retest all of their code to make sure nothing breaks because of your change.
     * Without directly changing the data class, how can you write an extension property that returns the same values as the code above?
     * When correctly implemented, you will be able to use the following code, and it will print the same message as the code shown at the start of this task.
