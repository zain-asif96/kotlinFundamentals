    /** An array is the simplest way to group an arbitrary number of values in your programs.
     * Like a grouping of solar panels is called a solar array, or how learning Kotlin opens up an array of possibilities for your programming career, an Array represents more than one value. Specifically, an array is a sequence of values that all have the same data type.

    // 2. List as MutableList
    /** A list is a collection of items that are ordered and can be accessed by their index. 
     * In Kotlin, you can create a list using the listOf() function. 
     * The listOf() function creates an immutable list, which means that you cannot add or remove items from the list after it has been created.
     * A list is an ordered, resizable collection, typically implemented as a resizable array. When the array is filled to capacity and you try to insert a new element, the array is copied to a new bigger array.
     * List is an interface that defines properties and methods related to a read-only ordered collection of items.
     * MutableList extends the List interface by defining methods to modify a list, such as adding and removing elements.
