// 6. Foldable phones
// Typically, a phone screen turns on and off when the power button is pressed. In contrast, if a foldable phone is folded, the main inner screen on a foldable phone doesn't turn on when the power button is pressed.

// In the initial code provided in the following code snippet, write a FoldablePhone class that inherits from the Phone class. It should contain the following:

// A property that indicates whether the phone is folded.
// A different switchOn() function behavior than the Phone class so that it only turns the screen on when the phone isn't folded.
// Methods to change the folding state.

open class Phone(var isScreenLightOn: Boolean = false){
    open fun switchOn() {
        isScreenLightOn = true
    }
    
    fun switchOff() {
        isScreenLightOn = false
    }
    
    fun checkPhoneScreenLight() {
        val phoneScreenLight = if (isScreenLightOn) "on" else "off"
        println("The phone screen's light is $phoneScreenLight.")
    }
}


class FoldablePhone(var isFolded: Boolean = true) : Phone() {
    override fun switchOn() {
        if(!isFolded){
            isScreenLightOn = true
        }
    }
    
    fun fold() {
        isFolded = true
    }
    
    fun unfold() {
        isFolded = false
    }
}
