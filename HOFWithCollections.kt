/** High Order Functions With Collections 
 * Higher-order functions are especially relevant to collections as they help you perform common tasks, like sorting or filtering, with less code. Now that you have a solid foundation working with collections, it's time to revisit higher-order functions.
 * In this codelab, you'll learn about a variety of functions that can be used on collection types, including forEach(), map(), filter(), groupBy(), fold(), and sortedBy(). In the process, you'll get additional practice working with lambda expressions.
