// 4. Song catalog
// Imagine that you need to create a music-player app.

// Create a class that can represent the structure of a song. The Song class must include these code elements:

// Properties for the title, artist, year published, and play count
// A property that indicates whether the song is popular. If the play count is less than 1,000, consider it unpopular.
// A method that prints a song description in this format:
// "[Title], performed by [artist], was released in [year published]."
